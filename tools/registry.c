/*
 * Tool registry — explicit static registration of built-in tools.
 *
 * The registry is a flat array of ToolDef pointers, populated once at
 * startup and never resized. We chose a flat array (as opposed to a hash
 * map, a linked list, or per-call discovery via constructor functions)
 * because:
 *
 *   - Lookups happen at most a few times per LLM turn; O(N) over a
 *     handful of tools is invisible next to a TCP round-trip.
 *   - A static array is trivial to reason about under TSan: there is no
 *     mutation after tools_init returns.
 *   - There is no hidden machinery — a reader can name every tool the
 *     agent knows by reading tools_init below.
 *
 * If you ever need to load tools dynamically (e.g. plugins discovered at
 * runtime), this is the file that grows. Today it does not.
